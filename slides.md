David then perceived that the <sc>Lord</sc> had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.

# 1 Kings 2:1--4
When David’s time to die drew near, he charged his son Solomon, saying: “I am about to go the way of all the earth.
Be strong, be courageous, and keep the charge of the <sc>Lord</sc> your God, walking in his ways and keeping his statutes, his commandments, his ordinances, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn.
Then the <sc>Lord</sc> will establish his word that he spoke concerning me: ‘If your heirs take heed to their way, to walk before me in faithfulness with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you a successor on the throne of Israel.’”
