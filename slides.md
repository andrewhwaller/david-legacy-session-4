# Deut 17:14--20
\[Israel's king\] must not acquire many wives for himself, or else his heart will turn away\.\.\.\.

# 1 Samuel 25:37--44
\[Abigail\] went after the messengers of David and became his wife. 
David also married Ahinoam of Jezreel; both of them became his wives.
Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Palti son of Laish, who was from Gallim.

# 2 Samuel 5:9--16
David then perceived that the <sc>Lord</sc> had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel. 
In Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron, David took more concubines and wives; and more sons and daughters were born to David.

# 1 Kings 2:1--4
When David’s time to die drew near, he charged his son Solomon, saying: “I am about to go the way of all the earth.
Be strong, be courageous, and keep the charge of the <sc>Lord</sc> your God, walking in his ways and keeping his statutes, his commandments, his ordinances, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn.
Then the <sc>Lord</sc> will establish his word that he spoke concerning me: ‘If your heirs take heed to their way, to walk before me in faithfulness with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you a successor on the throne of Israel.’”

# 1 Kings 9:3--9
The <sc>Lord</sc> said to him... “As for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, with integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you, and keeping my statutes and my ordinances, then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised your father David, saying, ‘There shall not fail you a successor on the throne of Israel.’ 
If you turn aside from following me, you or your children, and do not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them, then I will cut Israel off from the land that I have given them; and the house that I have consecrated for my name I will cast out of my sight; and Israel will become a proverb and a taunt among all peoples.
This house will become a heap of ruins; everyone passing by it will be astonished, and will hiss; and they will say, ‘Why has the <sc>Lord</sc> done such a thing to this land and to this house?’
Then they will say, ‘Because they have forsaken the <sc>Lord</sc> their God, who brought their ancestors out of the land of Egypt, and embraced other gods, worshiping them and serving them; therefore the <sc>Lord</sc> has brought this disaster upon them.’” 

<!--
* The fate of the nation is wrapped up in God's covenant with David and his descendants.
* Also note that David is spoken of in basically positive terms and the questionable history of the end of David's reign is elided in favor of a more general focus on the covanantal relationship between God and David's house.
  * The completion of the temple is consistently referred to as a fulfillment of God's promises to David, so the reaffirmation of those promises to Solomon and an exhortation to maintain faithfulness is natural here.

# How are David and his house used to describe the fate of Israel in and around the exile?

# Hosea 3
The <sc>Lord</sc> said to me again, “Go, love a woman who has a lover and is an adulteress, just as the <sc>Lord</sc> loves the people of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes.”
So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer of barley and a measure of wine.
And I said to her, “You must remain as mine for many days; you shall not play the whore, you shall not have intercourse with a man, nor I with you.”
For the Israelites shall remain many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or pillar, without ephod or teraphim.
Afterward the Israelites shall return and seek the <sc>Lord</sc> their God, and David their king; they shall come in awe to the <sc>Lord</sc> and to his goodness in the latter days.

# Amos 9:9--15
For lo, I will command, and shake the house of Israel among all the nations as one shakes with a sieve, but no pebble shall fall to the ground.
All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, who say, “Evil shall not overtake or meet us.” 

On that day I will raise up the booth of David that is fallen, and repair its breaches, and raise up its ruins, and rebuild it as in the days of old;
in order that they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations who are called by my name, says the <sc>Lord</sc> who does this. 

The time is surely coming, says the <sc>Lord</sc>, when the one who plows shall overtake the one who reaps, and the treader of grapes the one who sows the seed; 
the mountains shall drip sweet wine, and all the hills shall flow with it.
I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel, and they shall rebuild the ruined cities and inhabit them;
they shall plant vineyards and drink their wine, and they shall make gardens and eat their fruit.
I will plant them upon their land, and they shall never again be plucked up out of the land that I have given them, says the <sc>Lord</sc> your God.

<!--
* The term "booth" or "tent" prompts an ironic comparison to David's overture to God in 2 Samuel 7.
  * God has indeed built a permanent house through David's line in fulfillment of his promises, but despite Solomon's construction of a palace, David's house is still a tent.
  * David's house is not a permanent institution that can stand on its own; it must rely on its divine benefactor to repair it, rebuild it, and prevent its collapse.

# Isaiah 9:6--7
For a child has been born for us, a son given to us; authority rests upon his shoulders; and he is named Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. 
His authority shall grow continually, and there shall be endless peace for the throne of David and his kingdom.
He will establish and uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time onward and forevermore. 
The zeal of the <sc>Lord</sc> of hosts will do this.

# Isaiah 11:1--10
A shoot shall come out from the stump of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots.
The spirit of the <sc>Lord</sc> shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the <sc>Lord</sc>. 
His delight shall be in the fear of the <sc>Lord</sc>\.\.\.\. 

On that day the root of Jesse shall stand as a signal to the peoples; the nations shall inquire of him, and his dwelling shall be glorious. 
On that day the Lord will extend his hand yet a second time to recover the remnant that is left of his people, from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Ethiopia, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the coastlands of the sea. 
He will raise a signal for the nations, and will assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth. 
The jealousy of Ephraim shall depart, the hostility of Judah shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not be jealous of Judah, and Judah shall not be hostile towards Ephraim.

# 2 Samuel 23:1--5
Now these are the last words of David:\
The oracle of David, son of Jesse,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the oracle of the man whom God exalted,\
the anointed of the God of Jacob,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the favorite of the Strong One of Israel:\
The spirit of the <sc>Lord</sc> speaks through me,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his word is upon my tongue\.\.\.\.\
For he has made with me an everlasting covenant,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ordered in all things and secure.\
Will he not cause to prosper\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all my help and my desire?

# Isaiah 9:8--18
The Lord sent a word against Jacob, and it fell on Israel... but in pride and arrogance of heart they said:
“The bricks have fallen, but we will build with dressed stones; the sycamores have been cut down, but we will put cedars in their place.” 
So the <sc>Lord</sc> raised adversaries against them, and stirred up their enemies... and they devoured Israel with open mouth\.\.\.\.
The people did not turn to him who struck them, or seek the <sc>Lord</sc> of hosts.
So the <sc>Lord</sc> cut off from Israel head and tail, palm branch and reed in one day\.\.\.\.
For wickedness burned like a fire, consuming briers and thorns; it kindled the thickets of the forest, and they swirled upward in a column of smoke. 

# Isaiah 10:33--34
Look, the Sovereign, the <sc>Lord</sc> of hosts, will lop the boughs with terrifying power; the tallest trees will be cut down, and the lofty will be brought low. 
He will hack down the thickets of the forest with an ax, and Lebanon with its majestic trees will fall.

# Ezekiel 34:15--24 (cf. Jeremiah 23:1--8)
I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord <sc>Lord</sc>.
I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, but the fat and the strong I will destroy\.\.\.\.
Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them: I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
Because you pushed with flank and shoulder, and butted at all the weak animals with your horns until you scattered them far and wide, I will save my flock, and they shall no longer be ravaged; and I will judge between sheep and sheep. 
I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd.
And I, the <sc>Lord</sc>, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them; I, the <sc>Lord</sc>, have spoken.

# Ezekiel 37:22--28
Thus says the Lord <sc>god</sc>: I will take the people of Israel from the nations among which they have gone\.\.\.\.
I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king over them all.
Never again shall they be two nations, and never again shall they be divided into two kingdoms.
They shall never again defile themselves with their idols and their detestable things, or with any of their transgressions.
I will save them from all the apostasies into which they have fallen, and will cleanse them\.\.\.\.
My servant David shall be king over them; and they shall all have one shepherd.
They shall follow my ordinances and be careful to observe my statutes.
They shall live in the land that I gave to my servant Jacob, in which your ancestors lived...; and my servant David shall be their prince forever.
I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will bless them and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary among them forevermore.
My dwelling place shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
Then the nations shall know that I the <sc>Lord</sc> sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary is among them forevermore.

# 1. David's significance is *typological* and *genealogical*.
# 2. David and his house are utterly dependent on God for their existence and success.
# 3. Despite past failure, David's house is God's chosen instrument for the restoration of Israel.
