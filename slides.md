# Rebuilding the Fallen Tent

## Session 3: David and the Divided Kingdom

---
layout: statement

# Whose story is David participating in?
# **David is an inextricable part of the unfolding story of Israel's monarchy.**

<!--
* Gideon, Abimelech, Saul...
* David's story is deeply situated in the ongoing story of Israel's monarchy in the Deuteronomistic History.
  * The introduction of David and his initial characterization present him as someone who is tailor-made to fit into this story.
  * There is no other larger plot that David is a part of.

# Without looking, what's the basic plotline of David's accession to the throne?

<!--
* David kills Goliath, enters Saul service, fights against the Philistines, Saul becomes jealous, David flees, yada yada yada, David becomes king and Israel is at peace.
* By the way, everyone seems to love David. Saul's family, the people, everyone seems to be on David's side. David himself plays things more conservatively, but he immediately meets with public approval.
* Not really.

# 1 Samuel 24:16--22
Saul said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” Saul lifted up his voice and wept.
He said to David, “You are more righteous than I; for you have repaid me good, whereas I have repaid you evil.
Today you have explained how you have dealt well with me, in that you did not kill me when the <sc>Lord</sc> put me into your hands.
For who has ever found an enemy, and sent the enemy safely away?
So may the <sc>Lord</sc> reward you with good for what you have done to me this day.
Now I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.
Swear to me therefore by the <sc>Lord</sc> that you will not cut off my descendants after me, and that you will not wipe out my name from my father’s house.”
So David swore this to Saul. Then Saul went home; but David and his men went up to the stronghold.

# 1 Samuel 25:1
Now Samuel died; and all Israel assembled and mourned for him. They buried him at his home in Ramah.

<!--
* This moment is not only a tragic and poignant one between David and Saul, it is also Saul's acknowledgment that David will be king of Israel.
* Note especially the language of "establish the kingdom of Israel"
* Saul has the expectation that David will rule the nation in his place.

# 1 Samuel 25:37--44
About ten days later the <sc>Lord</sc> struck Nabal, and he died. 
When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be the <sc>Lord</sc> who has judged the case of Nabal’s insult to me, and has kept back his servant from evil; the <sc>Lord</sc> has returned the evildoing of Nabal upon his own head.”
Then David sent and wooed Abigail, to make her his wife.
When David’s servants came to Abigail at Carmel, they said to her, “David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife.”
She rose and bowed down, with her face to the ground, and said, “Your servant is a slave to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.”
Abigail got up hurriedly and rode away on a donkey; her five maids attended her. She went after the messengers of David and became his wife. 
David also married Ahinoam of Jezreel; both of them became his wives.
Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Palti son of Laish, who was from Gallim.

<!--
* This episode is interesting for a number of reasons.
  * First, the Nabal episode basically follows the scene between David and Saul in 1 Samuel 24, so the idea of David winning out against his enemies and becoming enriched or empowered as a result is very much in the air in these two chapters.
  * Second, the Bathsheba episode isn't the first time that David has come into conflict with someone, that person has died, and David has married the widow.
    * The main difference is that David's reception of Abigail into his household lacks the acrimony, violence, and tragedy of the Bathsheba episode.
    * God has struck down Nabal, not David.
  * Third, this episode indicates the direction of David's stewardship of the kingdom even before he formally becomes king.
    * This isn't just about David's marriage to Abigail.
    * David was previously promised Michal as his wife, but before that marital transaction was completed, David and Saul enter into open conflict.
    * Saul thus broke Michal's betrothal to David and gave her to Palti, which David clearly sees as a violation.
      * In 2 Samuel 3, David makes the demand, "Give me my wife Michal" as a condition for peace between Judah and Israel.
    * The major headline here, however, is David's multiplication of wives.

# Deut 17:14--20
When you have come into the land that the <sc>Lord</sc> your God is giving you, and have taken possession of it and settled in it, and you say, “I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are around me,” you may indeed set over you a king whom the <sc>Lord</sc> your God will choose.
One of your own community you may set as king over you; you are not permitted to put a foreigner over you, who is not of your own community.
Even so, he must not acquire many horses for himself, or return the people to Egypt in order to acquire more horses, since the <sc>Lord</sc> has said to you, “You must never return that way again.”
And he must not acquire many wives for himself, or else his heart will turn away; also silver and gold he must not acquire in great quantity for himself.
When he has taken the throne of his kingdom, he shall have a copy of this law written for him in the presence of the levitical priests.
It shall remain with him and he shall read in it all the days of his life, so that he may learn to fear the <sc>Lord</sc> his God, diligently observing all the words of this law and these statutes, neither exalting himself above other members of the community nor turning aside from the commandment, either to the right or to the left, so that he and his descendants may reign long over his kingdom in Israel.

<!--
* Even Saul has acknowledged David's eventual accession to Israel's throne.
* However, David is engaging in behavior that endangers the kingdom before he is even set over it.
* To put it another way, the "man after God's own heart" is doing precisely the thing that biblical law says will cause the heart of the king to "turn away."

# 2 Samuel 2:1--7
\[After he lamented Saul's death,\] David inquired of the <sc>Lord</sc>, “Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?”
The <sc>Lord</sc> said to him, “Go up.”
David said, “To which shall I go up?”
He said, “To Hebron.”
**So David went up there, along with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel.**
David brought up the men who were with him, every one with his household; and they settled in the towns of Hebron.
**Then the people of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.**
When they told David, “It was the people of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul,”
David sent messengers to the people of Jabesh-gilead, and said to them, “May you be blessed by the <sc>Lord</sc>, because you showed this loyalty to Saul your lord, and buried him!
Now may the <sc>Lord</sc> show steadfast love and faithfulness to you!
And I too will reward you because you have done this thing.
Therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.”

# 2 Samuel 2:8--11
But Abner son of Ner, commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ishbaal son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim.
He made him king over Gilead, the Ashurites, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and over all Israel.
Ishbaal, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years.
But the house of Judah followed David.
The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.

# 2 Samuel 5:1--5
Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and said, “Look, we are your bone and flesh.
For some time, while Saul was king over us, it was you who led out Israel and brought it in.
The <sc>Lord</sc> said to you: It is you who shall be shepherd of my people Israel, you who shall be ruler over Israel.”
So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron; and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the <sc>Lord</sc>, and they anointed David king over Israel.
David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and at Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.

# 2 Samuel 5:9--16
David occupied the stronghold \[of Zion\], and named it the city of David.
David built the city all around from the Millo inward.
And David became greater and greater, for the <sc>Lord</sc>, the God of hosts, was with him.
King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar trees, and carpenters and masons who built David a house.
David then perceived that the <sc>Lord</sc> had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel. 
In Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron, David took more concubines and wives; and more sons and daughters were born to David.
These are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.

<!--
* Keep in mind that the violation here is not primarily sexual, but political.
* David has declined to observe the law in this case and has built for himself a substantial household, i.e., a powerful family, rather than relying on God to establish his kingdom.
* It is ultimately the infighting caused by his children that diminishes the end of David's reign.

# 1 Kings 2:1--4
When David’s time to die drew near, he charged his son Solomon, saying: “I am about to go the way of all the earth.
Be strong, be courageous, and keep the charge of the <sc>Lord</sc> your God, walking in his ways and keeping his statutes, his commandments, his ordinances, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn.
Then the <sc>Lord</sc> will establish his word that he spoke concerning me: ‘If your heirs take heed to their way, to walk before me in faithfulness with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you a successor on the throne of Israel.’”
