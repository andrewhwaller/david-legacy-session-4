# Deut 17:14--20
\[Israel's king\] must not acquire many wives for himself, or else his heart will turn away\.\.\.\.

# 1 Samuel 25:37--44
\[Abigail\] went after the messengers of David and became his wife. 
David also married Ahinoam of Jezreel; both of them became his wives.
Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Palti son of Laish, who was from Gallim.

# 2 Samuel 5:9--16
David then perceived that the <sc>Lord</sc> had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel. 
In Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron, David took more concubines and wives; and more sons and daughters were born to David.

# 1 Kings 2:1--4
When David’s time to die drew near, he charged his son Solomon, saying: “I am about to go the way of all the earth.
Be strong, be courageous, and keep the charge of the <sc>Lord</sc> your God, walking in his ways and keeping his statutes, his commandments, his ordinances, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn.
Then the <sc>Lord</sc> will establish his word that he spoke concerning me: ‘If your heirs take heed to their way, to walk before me in faithfulness with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you a successor on the throne of Israel.’”

# 1 Kings 9:3--9
The <sc>Lord</sc> said to him... “As for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, with integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you, and keeping my statutes and my ordinances, then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised your father David, saying, ‘There shall not fail you a successor on the throne of Israel.’ 
If you turn aside from following me, you or your children, and do not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them, then I will cut Israel off from the land that I have given them; and the house that I have consecrated for my name I will cast out of my sight; and Israel will become a proverb and a taunt among all peoples.
This house will become a heap of ruins; everyone passing by it will be astonished, and will hiss; and they will say, ‘Why has the <sc>Lord</sc> done such a thing to this land and to this house?’
Then they will say, ‘Because they have forsaken the <sc>Lord</sc> their God, who brought their ancestors out of the land of Egypt, and embraced other gods, worshiping them and serving them; therefore the <sc>Lord</sc> has brought this disaster upon them.’” 

<!--
* The fate of the nation is wrapped up in God's covenant with David and his descendants.
* Also note that David is spoken of in basically positive terms and the questionable history of the end of David's reign is elided in favor of a more general focus on the covanantal relationship between God and David's house.
  * The completion of the temple is consistently referred to as a fulfillment of God's promises to David, so the reaffirmation of those promises to Solomon and an exhortation to maintain faithfulness is natural here.
